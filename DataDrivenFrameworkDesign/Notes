Need of Framework Design:

* Reusability
* Organised
* Manageable
* Understandable
* Scalable
* Cost effective
* Rules 
* Standard




1) Why we need data driven testing?
	When we want to test with multiple data its not a good practice to pass data for each methods/functions.
	Space complexity is more as we need to write pass many data in class file and thus creating multiple class for multiple scenarios
	To overcome this we need Data driven testing
	
2) What is Data driven testing?
	Passing data from excel, CSV or through parameterization & Data providers  in testng
	Above method actually reduce the time and space complexity which is good practice for framework design
	
3)  How you can achieve this?

	With help of selenium - web interaction
				 testNG   - test Management
				 apache POI & JXL(Java XL) Jars - Excel workbook/sheet reading 
				 
				 
	Steps with Apache POI jar:
	
		i) Read Excel file location
	   ii) Create Object for workbook
	  iii) Go to the sheet to be worked on
	   iv) Row iteration and get row values
	    v) cell iiteration and get cell values
	    
	    
	Steps with JSL hars:
	
	Note : JXL jar will work only if excel is saved in 97-2003 format.
